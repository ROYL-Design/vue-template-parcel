# vue-template-parcel

Vue and Parcel template for vue-cli.

Instead of Webpack, this template uses [Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) as module bundler, which is really fast and easy to use.

Update: Parcel 1.7 now has built-in Vue support! Yes!ðŸš€

### Usage

Install with [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli):

``` bash
$ vue init royl-design/vue-template-parcel my-project
```

Then install the dependencies:

``` bash
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
```

Launch the project with:

``` bash
$ npm run dev
```

### What's Included

- `npm run dev`: start dev server.

- `npm run build`: build with HTML/CSS/JS minification.
